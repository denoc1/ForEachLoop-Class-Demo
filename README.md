# ForEachLoop-Class-Demo

Declare and initialize three arrays (a String, int and double)

Use three *for each* loops to process elements in each array such that 
- each string in the String array is converted to all upper (use the toUpperCase() String method) and outputted
 - all numbers in the int array are added together, and the final sum is printed
 - each number in the double array is divided by 10 and outputted
